# FACE-AND-EYE-DETECTION-USING-OPENCV

This project uses **OpenCV** and **Haar Cascade classifiers** to detect faces and eyes in real-time from a webcam feed. It demonstrates how classical computer vision techniques can be used for surveillance, authentication, and human-computer interaction.

## üìå Project Overview

Face and eye detection is a foundational task in computer vision. This project captures live video, detects faces and eyes using pre-trained Haar cascades, and highlights them with bounding boxes. It‚Äôs fast, lightweight, and ideal for real-time applications.

## üöÄ Features

- Detects faces and eyes from live webcam feed
- Uses Haar cascade classifiers for efficient detection
- Draws bounding boxes around detected regions
- Real-time performance with minimal latency
- Clean exit on key press
